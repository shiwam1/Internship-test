# Internship-test
I have used K-means clustering algorithm to  give out a daily route for the salesperson about which stores they should visit to pitch the products of the company.  
Here I have used euclidean distance and ordered them in discending order where we find out which company are closer or far away.
Also some bar plots used to see the plots of Numriview, Pincodes, and Rating to the different companies.
Parallel plot is also used to see the various characterizing of the different clusters
I have also used the different libraries- "MASS", "cluster",
